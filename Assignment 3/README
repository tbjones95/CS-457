Compile instructions for this project. The project supports commands exactly as they are typed in the supported command list.

This program can be run in one of 2 ways:

1) The program can be passed a SQL file via standard input and it will perform all the operations
   in the file.

   ex: python main.py < PA2_test.sql will run the PA2_test SQL file.

2) The program can also be run similarly to SQL lite.

   ex: python main.py will print a ":>" to the screen. From here you can enter any of the supported
   SQL commands with the correct syntax and it will execute them.


Supported Commands:
